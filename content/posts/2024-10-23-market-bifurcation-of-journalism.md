## Reader's Willingness-to-pay

For medium-price journalism, mass readers have two types of willingness-to-pay:
1. Willingness-to-pay for leisure (magazine)
2. Willingness-to-pay to stay informed (newspaper)

## Reselling Business

The medium-price journalism was a reselling business:
- The top magazines and newspapers used to pay their best writers a dollar per word, to purchase the lucrative reselling power of making a profit of three dollars per word.
- The competition at medium-price was about quality, so well-written, long-form journalism were compensated well.

## Unprofitable
Medium-price journalism has become unprofitable since 2020s:
1. When TikTok/YouTube offers more personalized leisure for free, mass readers' willingness-to-pay to pay magazine for leisure is ruined
2. When Reddit/Instagram offers more personalized timeliness for free, mass readers' willingness-to-pay to pay newspaper to stay informed is ruined,

## Polarization

Medium-price journalism has two options, either go downscale towards TikTok (ultra low-price journalism), or upscale towards elite clubs (luxury journalism). [^1]
- National Geographies chose to transform itself into ultra low-price journalism [^2]. They laid all staff off and recruited freelancers to lower the costs. And they adopt a "short-and-shallow" guidelines to make their contents easier to consume.
- Axios decided to transform itself into luxury journalism [^3]. They treat key editors like limited partners, hold offline events, like summits and podcasts, to connect executives, insiders, and opportunities with each other.
