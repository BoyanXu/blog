To synthesize knowledge of a complicated subject that doesn't fit into intuition, humans need a time-consuming read/write process to build symbols that abstract cognition.

But symbols are fated to be forgotten. To accelerate rebuilds of cognition, we write notes, a cognition builds artifact, when being read will imperatively allocates attention.
- Lecture notes help a student prepare materials absorbed throughout the entire semester within just a final week.
- Code annotations help a developer quickly remember his choices of design made 6 months ago to reason behaviors of his software.

The readability of notes depends on the version of language it was written in.

In six months, mind drifts: `boyan:2024.4` → `boyan:2024.10`
- My notes written in `boyan:2024.4` are readable, interpretable, and compatible with `boyan:2024.10`.

In six years, mind shifts: `boyan:2024.4` → `boyan:2030.4`
- My notes written in `boyan:2024.4` are unreadable, uninterpretable, and incompatible with `boyan:2030.4`.

To communicate, I need to remove my cognition's dependency on me, on my mind, on my language.

- I need to write in the target audience's common language (lingua franca) like `computer-science:2024.10`, `democrats:2024.10`, `jazz:2024.10`, `expressionism:2024.10`, and `capitalism:2024.10`.
- Such writing turns private, tribal knowledge into public, open knowledge.

To be inherited, I must strip my cognition's dependency on today, on modernity, on fashion.
- I must write in a minimal set of invariants like good and bad, live and die, zero and one.
- Such writing turns temporary, ephemeral insights into constant, perpetual wisdom.
